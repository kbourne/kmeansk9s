							<h1>Applying Advanced Healthcare Analytics Techniques to Dog Healthcare</h1>
							<h2>Disease Trajectory Analysis: Cancer</h2>
							<p>August 22, 2022 - Ann Arbor, Michigan</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/matthew-henry-2Ts5HnA67k8-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>It is widely recognized in the veterinary world that dogs provide a unique model for health research that parallels the human environment.  Dogs are exposed to similar social and environmental elements as humans, exhibiting increases in many chronic conditions with dynamics similar to human patterns<a href="#ref1">&sup1;</a>.  Dogs also have shorter life spans, which allows researchers to observe their entire life course in a much more condensed time frame<a href="#ref2">&sup2;</a>.  Human healthcare analytics has advanced rapidly in recent years, paving the way for new and deeper insights into how data can be used to improve human healthcare.  Due to the similarities between human and dog healthcare, we seek to bring these analytical innovations to dog healthcare, with the hopes of finding deeper insights that can help both canine and human care. This analysis begins a number of traditional machine learning analysis techniques applied to the dataset.  It will conclude with the application of two cutting edge techniques that have emerged in human healthcare, but applied to this dog healthcare set as a way to determine how new techniques in a similar field can help this field advance.</p>
							<h3>Dataset Challenges</h3>
							<p>To fully understand this analysis, we need to first understand the challenges we face with the Dog Age Project (DAP) 
							dataset.  Challenges we identified include self-selection bias, an imbalance of the minority class versus the majority 
							class in much of the binary classification related analysis we performed, and the relatively small size of the dataset.  
							In addition, from a data science perspective, healthcare related data tends to have a set of common challenges that we 
							also saw in our own dataset.</p>
							<i>Self Selection Bias</i>
							<p>The respondents that the DAP data were collected from were self-nominated, and are a nonrandom sample of American dogs and their owners.   
							Participants filled out hundreds of survey questions relating to their companion dog, indicating that they were likely a particularly 
							dedicated set of dog owners with the time and capacity to fill out these surveys, and not fully representative of the overall 
							dog-owning population.  During our exploratory data analysis, we quickly identified that the survey participants tended to be 
							more affluent and well-educated than average, and minority populations are currently underrepresented.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/salaryhisto.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This selection bias has likely resulted in a sample of individuals that is not representative of the overall dog 
							owner population in the United States.  Ideally, we have a sample of data that is basically a mini version of 
							the overall dog owner population, but in our case, our sample is more representative of the more passionate, 
							affluent, and educated dog owner population.  While there is still value in the analysis that could be 
							conducted on this particular part of the population, it does need to be taken into account that any of 
							these results cannot be directly applied or generalized to the general population of dog owners. </p>
							<i>Imbalanced Minority Class</i>
							<p>As with most medical related datasets, the number of dogs that do not have cancer far outnumber the number that do, 
							causing our dataset to be heavily imbalanced for this particular type of analysis.  As part of our analysis, we set
							up “dummy” classifiers, including the “most frequent” classifier that basically just gives the most frequent data 
							class as the prediction 100% of the time.  For imbalanced datasets, where the majority class is the vast majority 
							of all of the data points, this classifier will show a high accuracy simply by predicting that majority class.  
							Obviously, this high accuracy is misleading and does not mean we have an effective model, but it does show the 
							imbalance in the data.</p>
							<p>Imbalanced Data - Dummy Classifier results - Strategy:  most_frequent</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="imbalanced-dummy-most-freq.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Accuracy: 93.7%	precision: 0%		recall: 0% 	f1 score: 90.7%</p>
							<p>However, as we will discuss, we were able to offset this using SMOTE to synthesize new minority class data 
							and balance the classes.  This is the same most frequent dummy classifier with the balanced dataset:</p>
							<p>Balanced Data - Dummy Classifier results - Strategy:  most_frequent</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="balanced-dummy-most-freq.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Accuracy: 49.9%	precision: 0%		recall: 0% 	f1 score: 33.2%</p>
							<p>We will show how this impacted the results of the analysis.</p>
