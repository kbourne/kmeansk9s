# Spaying/Neutering Analysis

This analysis examines the relationship between spaying/neutering in dogs and the social behaviors they exhibit in an effort to see if further empirical study of this relationship 
is warranted.

## Findings

This analysis unearthed several strong predictors pertaining to three broad behavior categories (Aggression, Excitability, and Miscellaneous). 
Classifier performance was firmly average, suggesting that further study with a more robust dataset is warranted.
