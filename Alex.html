<h1>Question 1 &ndash; Does owner income influence the health conditions reported in the study?</h1>

<p>Our study sought to analyze the greatest influences in a dog&rsquo;s health, and to determine whether any of these factors might present as valuable predictors for whether a dog may experience increased risk for certain health outcomes. Understandably, many of these factors are outside the control of the dog itself, and are instead influenced by the surrounding the environment, which is much more associated with characteristics of the dog owner.</p>
