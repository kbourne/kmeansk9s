<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Income has long been associated with the health in the United States. Studies have shown that income inequality has increased in recent decades in every state<sup>1</sup>, and that health disparities have also increased, with wealthier Americans enjoying greater health than those less affluent.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, healthcare costs are rising, and at a faster pace in the US than anywhere else in the world.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Many of us have felt the pressure to cut our expenses, as well as the shock that can come with a bill for medical care, even routine check-ups. This same pressure can lead to avoiding or delaying care. Research has shown for Americans in lower income groups have cut back on other expenses or avoided necessary treatment or medication at higher rates than Americans in higher income groups.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Given that income inequality has grown, that human healthcare costs have continued to rise, and that many of us are avoiding treatments or cutting other necessary expenses due to medical bills, it stands to reason that income of pet owners may also&nbsp; play a role in the health of our pets. In this study, we seek to determine whether there is a relationship between owner income and the various health conditions reported in the data set. Our hypothesis is that similar to human health, we would expect to see discrepancies in the rates of health conditions present in dogs, depending on owner income.</p>
<h2><strong>Question 1 &ndash; Does owner income influence the health conditions reported in the study?</strong></h2>
<p>Our overall study sought to analyze the greatest influences in a dog&rsquo;s health, and to determine whether any of these factors might present as valuable predictors for whether a dog may experience increased risk for certain health outcomes. Understandably, many of these factors are outside the control of the dog itself, and are instead influenced by the surrounding the environment, which is much more associated with characteristics of the dog owner.</p>
<p>As a result, one of our first questions was whether the income of the dog owner might act as a predictor for health outcomes. It stands to reason that dog owners with higher incomes may be able to afford expensive care for their pets, whether that care involves purchasing more expensive food, veterinary visits, prescriptions, and preventatives. However, rather than assume that dogs with higher income owners would be healthier, we simply intended to analyze for differences between income groups in the presentation of health outcomes.</p>
<p>To better understand the presentation of income in our data set, we needed to understand the distribution of different income groups. The below histogram describes the frequency of each group within the data. Records from owners who preferred not to answer were excluded (n = 3,357 out of 27,541 total records). While there is almost a normal distribution of income groups, it&rsquo;s important to note that the most frequent income groups was that of the owners making the highest income. This suggests that the data is skewed towards owners of a higher income group, rather than having an even distribution of owner income within the study.</p>
