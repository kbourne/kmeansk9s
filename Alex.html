<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Income has long been associated with the health in the United States. Studies have shown that income inequality has increased in recent decades in every state<sup>1</sup>, and that health disparities have also increased, with wealthier Americans enjoying greater health than those less affluent.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, healthcare costs are rising, and at a faster pace in the US than anywhere else in the world.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Many of us have felt the pressure to cut our expenses, as well as the shock that can come with a bill for medical care, even routine check-ups. This same pressure can lead to avoiding or delaying care. Research has shown for Americans in lower income groups have cut back on other expenses or avoided necessary treatment or medication at higher rates than Americans in higher income groups.<sup>4</sup></p>

<h2>Question 1 &ndash; Does owner income influence the health conditions reported in the study?</h2>

<p>Our study sought to analyze the greatest influences in a dog&rsquo;s health, and to determine whether any of these factors might present as valuable predictors for whether a dog may experience increased risk for certain health outcomes. Understandably, many of these factors are outside the control of the dog itself, and are instead influenced by the surrounding the environment, which is much more associated with characteristics of the dog owner.</p>
