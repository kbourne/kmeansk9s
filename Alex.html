<h2>Introduction - Income and Dog Health</h2>
<p>Income has long been associated with the health in the United States. Studies have shown that income inequality has increased in recent decades in every state<sup>1</sup>, and that health disparities have also increased, with wealthier Americans enjoying greater health than those less affluent.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, healthcare costs are rising, and at a faster pace in the US than anywhere else in the world.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Many of us have felt the pressure to cut our expenses, as well as the shock that can come with a bill for medical care, even routine check-ups. This same pressure can lead to avoiding or delaying care. Research has shown for Americans in lower income groups have cut back on other expenses or avoided necessary treatment or medication at higher rates than Americans in higher income groups.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Given that income inequality has grown, that human healthcare costs have continued to rise, and that many of us are avoiding treatments or cutting other necessary expenses due to medical bills, it stands to reason that income of pet owners may also&nbsp; play a role in the health of our pets. In this study, we seek to determine whether there is a relationship between owner income and the various health conditions reported in the data set. Our hypothesis is that similar to human health, we would expect to see discrepancies in the rates of health conditions present in dogs, depending on owner income.</p>
<h2><strong>Does owner income influence the health conditions reported in the study?</strong></h2>
<p>Our overall study sought to analyze the greatest influences in a dog&rsquo;s health, and to determine whether any of these factors might present as valuable predictors for whether a dog may experience increased risk for certain health outcomes. Understandably, many of these factors are outside the control of the dog itself, and are instead influenced by the surrounding the environment, which is much more associated with characteristics of the dog owner.</p>
<p>As a result, one of our first questions was whether the income of the dog owner might act as a predictor for health outcomes. It stands to reason that dog owners with higher incomes may be able to afford expensive care for their pets, whether that care involves purchasing more expensive food, veterinary visits, prescriptions, and preventatives. However, rather than assume that dogs with higher income owners would be healthier, we simply intended to analyze for differences between income groups in the presentation of health outcomes.</p>
<p>To better understand the presentation of income in our data set, we needed to understand the distribution of different income groups. The below histogram describes the frequency of each group within the data. Records from owners who preferred not to answer were excluded (n = 3,357 out of 27,541 total records). While there is almost a normal distribution of income groups, it&rsquo;s important to note that the most frequent income groups was that of the owners making the highest income. This suggests that the data is skewed towards owners of a higher income group, rather than having an even distribution of owner income within the study.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1zVxIfMkOYg1b3VgFlFBoTEtJIGcfmvNX" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Our next step was to perform a chi-squared analysis of our owner income data to determine whether each of the health outcomes reported in the data might be more prevalent in certain owner income groups than others. For each income group, we sought to analyze whether reported health conditions followed a pattern, for example, whether certain health outcomes became more common as owner income increased or decreased. Although most health conditions did not return a significant p-value (&gt; .05), two specific health conditions did identify differences among groups that were statistically significant. These included infectious disease (p = .0000383) and toxin consumption (p = &nbsp;0.04).</p>
<p>However, one drawback to the use of chi-squared analysis is that it can return a significant p-value due to any differences present in any of the analyzed groups, regardless of whether the difference is great enough to suggest further analysis. This was the case with our analysis of own analysis, as a normalized table reporting the percentage within groups reporting these health conditions was particularly small. Overall, this suggests that there does not appear to be a significant difference within income groups and the prevalence of health conditions reported in the data. The following plots demonstrate the distribution of records reporting the presence of infectious disease or toxin consumption across owner incomes. While there are differences among the different income groups, there does not appear to be any pattern within income groups or specific groups demonstrating a marked difference in the reporting of the health condition.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1yHLIebCJO1UTauWgzvCqJkopk9vK5RQD"

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=19unIzxw5oeguwnwRBAZYJbfzX2sPaocX" 
width="800" height="600"/></p>
<p>As can be seen in the above charts, the incidence of infectious disease and toxin consumption shows very little variation within the reported income groups. This suggests that owner income itself is not likely a good predictor of the incidence of the different health conditions reported in the data. As an alternative to owner wealth, we next looked to the median income of the neighborhood where the dog lived to determine if there might be any relationship between the wealth of the neighborhood and a dog's health.</p>
<p>Rather than use the raw median income values in the data set, we decided to group median income values (reported according to 2020 Census Tracts based on the owner&rsquo;s address) into quartiles and use the same chi squared analysis to determine if there might be any differences in prevalence of health conditions within the different quartiles. Our first step in the analysis was to understand the frequency of the different median income quartiles in the data:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=12PHQu4FDlKd9mLk8EVy5bKm6jYXzuldc"
width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>The above chart describes a different picture from the view of owner income, which indicated that the largest group of responses came from those in the top income group. Instead, in the case of the income quartiles, the largest income group (Quartile 4) is now the least frequent group in then data. The vast majority of responses come from Quartiles 1 and 2, which are the lower median income quartiles.</p>
<p>To analyze whether certain health conditions may be more prevalent in certain income quartiles, we performed a Chi-Squared analysis on the grouped data. Similar to our Chi-Squared analysis against owner income, we identified differences within groups that exceeded a significant p-value. However, these differences were very small, despite being differences among the median income quartiles. The health conditions which returned significant results included cancer (p = 0.00004), infectious disease (p = 0.000), oral health conditions (p = 0.00576), and toxin consumption (p = 0.00477). Again, while our Chi Squared analysis identified differences within groups, the differences within groups were largely negligible and did not truly suggest a relationship between the median income of the neighborhood and the health of the dogs in the study.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1V5uC4kzow97Ba9Rg9QYGdtNet5mJ208w"

width="900" height="500"/></p>
<p>Ultimately, it would appear that the prevalence of the different health conditions in our data set seems pretty evenly distributed across owners of all income groups, and even different median incomes. This is in contrast to our initial hypothesis that dogs in wealthier incomes would be healthier than dogs owned by owners with lower incomes, or that dogs living in more affluent neighborhoods would be healthier.</p>
<p>That said, there are many potential confounds in our data set. For example, this analysis simply looks into the prevalence of dog health conditions across different income groups. It is possible that dogs of certain income groups may encounter certain health conditions at an earlier age compared to other income groups. This would be an interesting follow up study, as the current analysis focused on whether the health condition was reported at all for a given dog. Similar to humans, as dogs age they are likely to experience some deleterious health conditions, although it is possible that these health conditions may be encountered differently based on environment, care, experience, etc.</p>

	<h2><strong>Does the source of acquisition influence a dog's health?</strong></h2>
	<span class="image main"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1EDwcQ-zHQLJg2v5YPS1W566b5rsyPPs_" alt="" /></span>

<h2>Introduction - Source of Acquisition and Health</h2>
<p>There has been ongoing debate as to whether it is better to adopt a dog rather than purchase a puppy from a shop or a breeder. "Adopt, don't shop" is a common phrase suggesting that the responsible action for those interested in having a dog is to save an animal from a rescue shelter. While adopting from a rescue shelter may seem responsible in some ways, it is reasonable to be concerned about the health of an adopted dog, especially when there is no clear available history for the dog avaialble from the shelter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a common misconception persists that purebred dogs (which can often be found through breeders) carry health issues due to inbreeding. However, recent research suggests that hereditary diseases can be just as common in mixed-breed vs purebreed dogs.<sup>5</sup> Given that common misconceptions, our team decided to study the prevalence of the health conditions reported in the Dog Aging Project in dogs that were rescued from shelters vs those acquired through a breeder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>	
<h2>Methods</h2>	
<p>In addition to investigating wealth as a predictor of dog health, we also decided to investigate whether the source of a dog might act as a predictor of the health conditions reported in the study. It is possible that dogs spending time in a shelter, or have been abandoned, may have been at greater risk for health conditions, or may have received less care than dogs that had been acquired at a young age directly from a professional breeder. Thus, we hypothesized that dogs acquired from certain sources might present the incidence of certain health conditions at a greater rate.</p>
<p>Our first step was to analyze the frequency of the different sources reported in the data. It quickly became clear that the dogs in the data set were typically acquired from one of two sources – either directly from a breeder, or through a rescue group or shelter. All other groups were present in the data at such a lower frequency that we decided to focus our analysis on dogs acquired through either of these 2 sources.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1F5QijFMBLW1PKrtKguC1Ch52ZU1m7LPw" 
width="900" height="500"/></p>
<p>To analyze differences between these groups, we again performed a chi-squared test to determine whether any of the health conditions reported in the study were more frequent in either group. Although certain health conditions returned significant p-values but negligible differences between the two sources, a few interesting results were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infectious disease was reported more frequently in adopted dogs (30%) than dogs acquired from a breeder (25%).</li>
<li>Oral health conditions were reported more frequently in adopted dogs (30%) than dogs acquired from a breeder (24%).</li>
<li>Trauma was reported more frequently in adopted dogs (31%) than dogs acquired from a breeder (24%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our chi-squared test results indicate that for certain health conditions, there seem to be significant differences in reported incidence between dogs acquired from a breeder vs. those acquired from a rescue group or shelter. The below charts show the normalized difference in frequency between dogs acquired from a breeder vs a shelter for dogs impacted by infectious disease, oral health conditions, or trauma.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1yq7lMKHdClHAKiyt9a5IIDmpUV8qv1Qf"

width="900" height="500"/></p>
<p>Due to these identified differences, we attempted to build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a given dog may experience one of these health conditions. In order to build an effective model, we tested the dog demographic features present in the data for those that had the strongest absolute correlation value with the health condition we wanted to predict. However, our analysis of the dog demographic variables in the data showed that they did not seem related to whether a dog is adopted or acquired through a breeder. The following tables show the dog demographic data attributes with the strongest correlation values for each infectious disease, oral health conditions, and trauma. </p>

</table>
<p>A brief review of the top correlated variables for each health condition would suggest that these variables are not necessarily related to whether a dog is adopted or acquired through a breeder. Interestingly, each of the tables include variables indicating the amount of time spent at alternate residences owned by the dog owner.However, these variables do not seem to be especially relevant to the health conditions themselves (e.g., it seems unlikely that the time spent at different residences owned by the dog owner would lead to infectious disease, oral conditions, or trauma).</p>
<p>Despite the list of top correlated variables seeming unexpected, we decided to use these variables to build machine learning models, with the intent of the model being to predict whether a given dog that has been either adopted or acquired via a breeder would report the health condition that is being tested. Due to the mixture of variables present within each of the top correlated attributes, we decided to use a Random Forest classifier.</p>
<p>In addition to the features most correlated with each health condition, we supplemented the data used to train each model with the dog demographic features that were found to have the highest correlation with the acquired source (adopted or through a breeder). The assumption is that features that correlate strongly with the source may aid the model in classifying whether the health condition would be reported for the dog. The following table provides the dog demographic variables which were shown to have the strongest absolute value correlation with the sourcing of the dog:</p>

	<h3>Results - Overall</h3>
	<p>In order to evaluate the performance of each model, we compared the accuracy and F1 scores obtained by the model against a dummy classifier that would simply predict the dominant class within the data. The classes in the data were particularly unbalanced, with the reported presence of the health conditions being the minority class. For example, in the Infectious Disease test data used to evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model, 5054 records (72%) of records belonged to the majority class with the dog not report infectious disease.</p>
	<p>Clearly, our models were trained on an unbalanced dataset. For each of the below Random Forest classifiers, a dummy classifier that predicted the dominant class (the health condition being absent) achieved higher accuracy scores than the Random Forest Models. As a result, we chose the f1-score as the more accurate means of assessing our model, since a high accuracy score could be achieved just using the dummy classifier. Given the imbalanced data, we also felt it important that misclassifications in terms of missed positives is important, since the purpose of the model is to be able to predict the presence of the health condition.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, each of our classification models achieved modest results, at best.
	<h3>Results - Infectious Disease Classifier</h3>
	<p>Our Random Forest model achieved mediocre performance when attempting to classify the presence of infectious disease in our test data. Overall, the model was outperformed by the dummy classifier, and achieved very low Precision and Recall, especially with regards to the minorty class. As can be seen in the below Confusion Matrix, the model misclassified much of the time across both classes. Most importantly, the model only correctly labeled 895 out of the 1,946 positive cases (labelled "2" in the Confusion Matrix plot below) in the test data. The model also incorrecly labeled 2,046 cases of truly negative records as being positive.</p>
	<p>In comparison, the dummy classifier achieved an overall accuracy score of 72% by simply guessing the dominant class at all times. Of course, while the overall accuracy of the dummy classifier may seem adequate, the dummy classifier missed all instances of positive cases in the test data.</p>	
	<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1G16jO4chpeRJ5MZpCjr8EXiB-wKYCMyk" 
width="600" height="450"/></p>
	<p>The following table provides the importance of each of the selected features used in the Random Forest model to classify the presence of infectious disease. Again, the model was not particularly effective at identifying records where infectious disease was present in the test data. However, the model was driven by the following features when making classification decisions. It is interesting that the feature 'dd_estrous_cycle_count' was the feature with the greatest importance, though the feature did not demonstrate much of a correlation with either the presence of infectious disease or the acquired source (adopted vs acquired through a breeder). The same can also be said of the other top features, sucha as 'dd_spay_method', 'dd_litter_count', and 'dd_age_basis'.</p>	
	<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=17IMEyz7_WSpCRARxFO0bGDq_I-TYtF42" 
width="900" height="500"/></p>
	<h3>Results - Oral Health Conditions Classifier</h3>
	<p>Our Random Forest model achieved better performance when attempting to classify the presence of oral health conditions within the test data. This model achieved an overall accuracy 67%, compared to 75% for the dummy classifier. Compared to the model for classifying infectious disease, this model returned fewer Type 1 and Type 2 errors, correctly classifying 895 positive cases, but also misclassifying 1,256 truly negative as though they were positive. While this model's performance was better than the classifier for infectious disease, it does not seem accurate enough to reliably classify cases of oral health conditions.</p>
	<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1sZFoa3bbJkcymh7XQggSN68TfFsFpAl4" 
width="600" height="450"/></p>
	<p>The following table provides the importance of each of the selected features used in the Random Forest model to classify the presence of oral health conditions.
		Unlike the set feature importance plot for the infectious disease model, some of these features seem to make intuitive sense. The feature 'dd_age_years' demonstrated a somewhat moderate correlation with the health condition, as did 'ddacquired_year' and 'dd_birth_year'. That said, although these were the most important features in this specific model, the model's performance suggests that we should not take too much stock in these features as being valuable predictors for the presence of oral health issues in dogs.</p>
