<p>Income has long been associated with the health in the United States. Greater wealth provides the ability to pay for medical care and medications that those less wealthy may not be able to afford. Studies have also shown that in recent decades, income inequality has increased in every state in the US<sup>1</sup>. At the same time as the wealth gap continues to grow, so do health disparities in the US, with wealthier Americans enjoying better health.<sup>2</sup> Studies have also shown that healthcare costs continue to rise at a faster pace in the US than anywhere else in the world.<sup>3</sup> Together, these issues have the potential to fuel each other and accelerate their negative effects on our wellbeing.</p>
<p>As healthcare costs continue to rise, many of us have felt the pressure to cut expenses, whether from avoiding the shock of an unexpected medical bill (even for routine check-ups) or a prescription medication. This same pressure can lead to avoiding or delaying needed care. Research has demonstrated this effect, and the way that it impacts Americans of different income groups differently, as Americans in lower income groups have cut back on other expenses or avoided necessary treatment or medication at higher rates than those in higher income groups.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Given that income inequality has grown, that human healthcare costs have continued to rise, and that many of us are avoiding treatments or cutting other necessary expenses due to medical bills, it stands to reason that the wealth of pet owners may play a role in the health of our pets. In this study, we seek to determine whether there is a relationship between dog owner wealth and the various health conditions reported in the data collected by the Dog Aging Project. Our hypothesis is that similar to human health, we expect to see discrepancies in the rates of health conditions present in dogs depending on owner wealth.</p>
<h2><strong>Does owner income influence the health conditions reported in the study?</strong></h2>
<p>Our overall study sought to analyze the greatest influences in a dog's health, and to determine whether any of these factors might present as valuable predictors for whether a dog may experience increased risk for certain health outcomes. Understandably, many of these factors are outside the control of the dog itself, and are instead influenced by the surrounding the environment, which is much more associated with characteristics of the dog owner.</p>
<p>One of our first questions was whether the income of the dog owner might act as a predictor for health outcomes. It stands to reason that dog owners with higher incomes may be able to afford expensive care for their pets, whether that care involves purchasing more expensive food, veterinary visits, prescriptions, and preventatives. However, rather than assume that dogs with higher income owners would be healthier, we simply intended to analyze for differences between income groups in the presentation of health outcomes.</p>
<p>To better understand the presentation of income in our data set, we analyzed the distribution of different income groups in the Owner data set from the Dog Aging Project. The below histogram describes the frequency of each group within the data. Records from owners who preferred not to answer were excluded (n = 3,357 out of 27,541 total records). While there is almost a normal distribution of income groups, it's important to note that the most frequent income groups was that of the owners making the highest income. This suggests that the data is skewed towards owners of a higher income group, rather than having an even distribution of owner income within the study.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1zVxIfMkOYg1b3VgFlFBoTEtJIGcfmvNX" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Our next step was to perform a chi-square analysis of our owner income data to determine whether each of the health outcomes reported in the data might be more prevalent in certain owner income groups than others. For each income group, we sought to analyze whether reported health conditions followed a pattern, for example, whether certain health outcomes became more common as owner income increased or decreased. Although most health conditions did not return a significant p-value (&gt; .05), two specific health conditions did identify differences among groups that were statistically significant. These included infectious disease (p = .0000383) and toxin consumption (p = &nbsp;0.04).</p>
<p>However, one drawback to the use of chi-square analysis is that it can return a significant p-value due to small differences present in any of the analyzed groups. In other words, even a very small difference that does not necessarily suggest further analysis can return a statistically significant p-value. We found this to be the case with our analysis, as normalized tables of the percentage reporting the presence of the health condition within each income group showed very slight differences. Overall, this suggests that there does not appear to be a significant difference within income groups and the prevalence of the different health conditions reported in the data. The following plots demonstrate the distribution of records reporting the presence of infectious disease or toxin consumption across owner incomes. While there are differences among the different income groups, there does not appear to be any pattern within income groups or specific groups demonstrating a marked difference in the reporting of the health condition.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1yHLIebCJO1UTauWgzvCqJkopk9vK5RQD"

width="800" height="600"/></p>
<p>As can be seen in the above charts, the incidence of infectious disease and toxin consumption shows very little variation within the reported income groups. This suggests that owner income itself is not likely a good predictor of the incidence of the different health conditions reported in the data. As an alternative to owner wealth, we next looked to the median income of the neighborhood where the dog lived to determine if there might be any relationship between the wealth of the neighborhood and a dog's health.</p>
<p>Rather than use the raw median income values in the data set, we decided to group median income values (reported according to 2020 Census Tracts based on the owner&rsquo;s address) into quartiles and use the same chi-square analysis to determine if there might be any differences in prevalence of health conditions within the different quartiles. Our first step in the analysis was to understand the frequency of the different median income quartiles in the data. It is important to note that our method of creating quartiles split the data into 4 evenly spaced intervals, rather than 4 intervals that would create evenly sized groups.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=12PHQu4FDlKd9mLk8EVy5bKm6jYXzuldc"
width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>The above chart describes a different picture from the view of owner income, which indicated that the largest group of responses came from those in the top income group. Instead, in the case of the income quartiles, the largest income group (Quartile 4) is now the least frequent group in then data. The vast majority of responses come from Quartiles 1 and 2, which are the lower median income quartiles.</p>
<p>To analyze whether certain health conditions may be more prevalent in certain income quartiles, we performed a chi-square analysis on the grouped data. Similar to our previous analysis against owner income, we identified differences within groups that exceeded a significant p-value. However, these differences within groups were again very small. The health conditions which returned significant results included cancer (p = 0.00004), infectious disease (p = 0.000), oral health conditions (p = 0.00576), and toxin consumption (p = 0.00477). Again, while our chi-square tests identified differences within groups, the actual differences within groups were very small and did not truly suggest a relationship between the median income of the neighborhood and the health of the dogs in the study.</p>

<h2>Discussion - Owner Income and Dog Health</h2> 
<p>Our analysis of owner income and median census tract income from the Dog Aging Project reveals that while there seem to be slight differences in the prevalence of health conditions between groups, these differences are very slight. In other words, we did not find anything more than negligible differences in the prevelance of the health conditions across different income groups. As a second means of investigating the prevalence of health conditions across income, we also performed chi-square analysis of the same health conditions across grouped quartiles of median income. This was intended to discern whether differences in health may even be influenced by the wealth of the surrounding neighborhood, if not by the individual dog owner's income. Our analysis of the different median income groups revealed similar results. The prevalence of different health incomes seemed pretty evenly distributed across median income groups.</p>
<p>Together, our analysis leads to the conclusion that we must accept the null hypothesis that there is no demonstrable relationship between owner income and the health conditions in the data set. The same can be said of median income - we must accept the null hypthosesis that there is not demonstrable relationship between median income and the prevalence of health conditions, at least not in the Dog Aging Project Owner data set. It is important to note that there could be a relationship between income and health, but that the means of our analysis simply did not reveal it. It is also possible that the limited number or records in our data set may have impeded our ability to demonstrate the relationship.</p>
<p>It is important to note a few potential confounds in the Dog Aging Project Owner data set. For example, our analysis of this data set simply looked into the prevalence of dog health conditions across different income groups. We identified early on in our analysis that the data was skewed towards owners of higher income, as the largest group of participants in the study were those in the highest income group. It's possible that the over-representation of participants from the highest income group may have influenced our results, and that a more evenly distributed set of participants across income levels may have produced different results. It is also important to note the limited size of our overall data set. Hopefully, the Dog Aging Project will continue to collect and publish data for this data set, and that in time the presence of different income groups will even out.</p>
<p>It is also possible that there may be a different relationship between wealth and health. For example, it could be that dogs of certain income groups may encounter certain health conditions at an earlier age compared to other income groups. This would be an interesting follow up study, as the current analysis focused on whether the health condition was reported at all for a given dog. Similar to humans, as dogs age they are likely to experience some deleterious health conditions, although it is possible that these health conditions may be encountered differently based on environment, care, experience, etc. A future study may benefit from a different data set that looks specifically into the age of dogs that develop the same health conditions, and to compare the age of onset of the condition across different income groups.</p>

	<h2><strong>Section 2 - Analysis of Acquisition Source and Dog Health</strong></h2>

<p>There has been ongoing debate as to whether it is better to adopt a dog rather than purchase a puppy from a shop or a breeder. "Adopt, don't shop" is a common phrase suggesting that the responsible action for those interested in having a dog is to save an animal from a rescue shelter. While adopting from a rescue shelter may seem responsible in some ways, it is reasonable to be concerned about the health of an adopted dog, especially when there is no clear available history for the dog avaialble from the shelter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a common misconception persists that purebred dogs (which can often be found through breeders) carry health issues due to inbreeding. However, recent research suggests that hereditary diseases can be just as common in mixed-breed vs purebreed dogs.<sup>5</sup> As there does not seem to be a clear consensus whether adopted or bred dogs are healthier, our team decided to study the prevalence of the health conditions reported in the Dog Aging Project in dogs that were rescued from shelters vs those acquired through a breeder.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>	
<p>In addition to investigating wealth as a predictor of dog health, we also decided to investigate whether the source of a dog might act as a predictor of the health conditions reported in the study. It is possible that dogs spending time in a shelter, or have been abandoned, may have been at greater risk for health conditions, or may have received less care than dogs that had been acquired at a young age directly from a professional breeder. Thus, we hypothesized that dogs acquired from certain sources might present the incidence of certain health conditions at a greater rate.</p>
<p>Our first step was to analyze the frequency of the different sources reported in the data. It quickly became clear that the dogs in the data set were typically acquired from one of two sources – either directly from a breeder (n = 10,406), or through a rescue group or shelter (n = 10,804). All other sources were present in the data at such a lower frequency that we decided to focus our analysis on dogs acquired through either of these 2 sources. It is also helpful from a comparison perspective that both sources were present in the data with similar overall counts.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1F5QijFMBLW1PKrtKguC1Ch52ZU1m7LPw" 
width="900" height="500"/></p>
<p>To analyze differences between these groups, we again performed a chi-square test to determine whether any of the health conditions reported in the study were more frequent in either group. Similar to our chi-square tests performed on owner income and median income, we noted that multiple tests returned significant p-values, but very slight actual differences in the incidence of the health condition. However, we identified a few health conditions for which significant p-values were returned and the actual differences the presence of the health condition seemed large enough to warrant further investigation. For each of the following, the returned p-value was less than .001.</p>
<ul>
<li>Infectious disease was reported more frequently in adopted dogs (30%) than dogs acquired from a breeder (25%).</li>
<li>Oral health conditions were reported more frequently in adopted dogs (30%) than dogs acquired from a breeder (24%).</li>
<li>Trauma was reported more frequently in adopted dogs (31%) than dogs acquired from a breeder (24%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our chi-square test results indicate that for certain health conditions, there seem to be significant differences in reported incidence between dogs acquired from a breeder vs. those acquired from a rescue group or shelter. The below charts show the normalized difference in frequency between dogs acquired from a breeder vs a shelter for dogs impacted by infectious disease, oral health conditions, or trauma.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1yq7lMKHdClHAKiyt9a5IIDmpUV8qv1Qf"

width="900" height="500"/></p>
<p>Due to these identified differences, we attempted to build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a given dog may experience one of these health conditions. In order to build an effective model, we tested the dog demographic features present in the data for those that had the strongest absolute correlation value with the health condition we wanted to predict. However, our analysis of the dog demographic variables in the data showed that they did not seem related to whether a dog is adopted or acquired through a breeder. The following tables show the dog demographic data attributes with the strongest correlation values for each infectious disease, oral health conditions, and trauma. </p>

<p>A brief review of the top correlated variables for each health condition would suggest that these variables are not necessarily related to whether a dog is adopted or acquired through a breeder. Interestingly, each of the tables include variables indicating the amount of time spent at alternate residences owned by the dog owner. However, these variables do not seem to be especially relevant to the health conditions themselves (e.g., it seems unlikely that the time spent at different residences owned by the dog owner would lead to infectious disease, oral conditions, or trauma).</p>
<p>Despite the list of top correlated variables seeming unexpected, we decided to use these variables to build machine learning models, with the intent of the model being to predict whether a given dog that has been either adopted or acquired via a breeder would report the health condition that is being tested. The resulting features pulled into each model contain a mix of numerical, categorical, and ordinal features. For example, the number of weeks spent in an alternate residence is numeric, but features such as dd_acquired_year and dd_birth_year are ordinal features in a numeric format (since they represent the year of birth or acquisition, such as "2012" vs "2017"). Categorical features such as dd_activities_search_and_rescue are also present, where the numeric value represents whether the dog participated in search and rescue activities as a primary (1), secondary (2), or additional activity (3). Due to the mixture of variables present within each of the top correlated attributes and the programmatic method of feature selection, we decided to use a Random Forest classifier as it can effectively leverage all of these different feature types without requiring much additional manipulation.</p>
<p>In addition to the features most correlated with each health condition, we supplemented the data used to train each model with the dog demographic features that were found to have the highest correlation with the acquired source (adopted or through a breeder). The assumption is that features that correlate strongly with the source may aid the model in classifying whether the health condition would be reported for the dog. The following table provides the dog demographic variables which were shown to have the strongest absolute value correlation with the sourcing of the dog:</p>

	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>In order to evaluate the performance of each model, we compared the accuracy and F1 scores obtained by the model against a dummy classifier that would simply predict the dominant class within the data. The classes in the data were particularly unbalanced, with the reported presence of the health conditions being the minority class. For example, in the Infectious Disease test data used to evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model, 5054 records (72%) of records belonged to the majority class with the dog not report infectious disease.</p>
	<p>Clearly, our models were trained on an unbalanced dataset. For each of the below Random Forest classifiers, a dummy classifier that predicted the dominant class (the health condition being absent) achieved higher accuracy scores than the Random Forest Models. As a result, we chose the f1-score as the more accurate means of assessing our model, since a high accuracy score could be achieved just using the dummy classifier. Given the imbalanced data, we also felt it important that misclassifications in terms of missed positives is important, since the purpose of the model is to be able to predict the presence of the health condition.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, each of our classification models achieved modest results, at best.
	<h3>Results - Infectious Disease Classifier</h3>
	<p>Our Random Forest model achieved mediocre performance when attempting to classify the presence of infectious disease in our test data. Overall, the model was outperformed by the dummy classifier, and achieved very low Precision and Recall, especially with regards to the minorty class. As can be seen in the below Confusion Matrix, the model misclassified much of the time across both classes. Most importantly, the model only correctly labeled 895 out of the 1,946 positive cases (labelled "2" in the Confusion Matrix plot below) in the test data. The model also incorrecly labeled 2,046 cases of truly negative records as being positive.</p>
	<p>In comparison, the dummy classifier achieved an overall accuracy score of 72% by simply guessing the dominant class at all times. Of course, while the overall accuracy of the dummy classifier may seem adequate, the dummy classifier missed all instances of positive cases in the test data.</p>

	<p>The following table provides the importance of each of the selected features used in the Random Forest model to classify the presence of infectious disease. Again, the model was not particularly effective at identifying records where infectious disease was present in the test data. However, the model was driven by the following features when making classification decisions. It is interesting that the feature 'dd_estrous_cycle_count' was the feature with the greatest importance, though the feature did not demonstrate much of a correlation with either the presence of infectious disease or the acquired source (adopted vs acquired through a breeder). The same can also be said of the other top features, sucha as 'dd_spay_method', 'dd_litter_count', and 'dd_age_basis'.</p>

	<h3>Results - Oral Health Conditions Classifier</h3>
	<p>Our Random Forest model achieved better performance when attempting to classify the presence of oral health conditions within the test data. This model achieved an overall accuracy 67%, compared to 75% for the dummy classifier. Compared to the model for classifying infectious disease, this model returned fewer Type 1 and Type 2 errors, correctly classifying 825 positive cases, but also misclassifying 1,256 truly negative as though they were positive. While this model's performance was better than the classifier for infectious disease, it does not seem accurate enough to reliably classify cases of oral health conditions.</p>

width="600" height="450"/></p>
	<p>The following table provides the importance of each of the selected features used in the Random Forest model to classify the presence of oral health conditions.
		Unlike the set feature importance plot for the infectious disease model, some of these features seem to make intuitive sense. The feature 'dd_age_years' demonstrated a somewhat moderate correlation with the health condition, as did 'ddacquired_year' and 'dd_birth_year'. That said, although these were the most important features in this specific model, the model's performance suggests that we should not take too much stock in these features as being valuable predictors for the presence of oral health issues in dogs.</p>

width="900" height="500"/></p>
	<h3>Results - Trauma Classifier</h3>
    <p>Once again, our Random Forest model achieved middling performance when attempting to classify the presence of trauma in our test data. The model returned an overall accuracy of only 53%, compared to the dummy classifier's 73% accuracy obtained by simply guessing the majority class value ("0" indicating no trauma) in all cases. As can be seen in the confusion matrix below, the Random Forest classifier mislabeled many cases - incorrectly labeling 757 records as negative (~40% of the truly positive records in the test data), and incorrectly labeling 2,523 records as positive which were truly negative (~50% of truly negative cases).</p>
    <p>This suggests that in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, the model performed poorly and would not be useful in a real world setting.</p>
	<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1qOwoygQW6CKu_CeyyYu3J773kr3JcCpc" 
        width="600" height="450"/></p>
    <p>In terms of feature importance, we can see again that the feature's showing the strongest correlation values with the predictied health condition were not necessarily the most important when making classifications. The feature 'dd_birth_year' was by far the most important of the features leveraged in the model, which demonstrated a very weak correlation with the presence of trauma amongst dogs that were adopted or acquired through a breeder. Similar to the other models discussed above, the performance of this model suggests we should not rely on these feature importance values too much as being critical to predicting the presence of trauma.</p>

	<h2>Discussion - Source of Acquisition and Dog Health</h2> 
    <p>Our chi-square analysis of acquisition source and health conditions in dogs revealed significant differences in the prevalence of infectious disease, oral conditions, and trauma. Specifically, we found that adopted dogs present these conditions more frequently than dogs acquired from a breeder in our data set from the Dog Aging Project. However, our Random Forest classification models performed poorly against our test data and did not achieve accuracy, precision, or recall scores that would suggest the models were useful, even against our limited data set. It seems safe to say that these models would not be useful in the real world.</p>
    <p>One major limitation of our models is that they were trained with very limited data. The overall data set from the Dog Aging Project contained only 27k records in total, which in many cases would not be a large enough data set without the presence of very strongly correlated variables. This results in even smaller data sets when only the records for each health condition were present. For example, out of the full data set, only ~7.6k records reported the presence of oral health conditions, and only 5.7k of those applied to dogs that were either adopted or picked up from a breeder. It seems likely that the training of our data would have suffered from the small data sets used to train them. Future efforts at building similar models would likely benefit from a much larger data set.</p>
    <p>Another major challenge in building machine learning models to predict the presence of a health condition is working with minority classes that are particularly small. For example, although the data set contained 21k records for dogs that were adopted or acquired from a breeder, only 5.8k records reported the presence of infectious disease. The number of records in the majority class (no reported infectious disease) is about three times larger, with 15.3k records. In this case, the machine learning models had very limited data to learn from when seeking to label the minority class. Our efforts in building an effective model likely would benefitted from the use a technique to improve learning from the minority class. Current techniques incldue the use of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), which is leveraged in our Cancer Trajectory machine learning models to improve performance.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, our approach leveraged a very limited set of features to use when training the model. The data set from the Dog Aging Project included a small overall number of records (27k), but included more than 600 individual features. Early on in our efforts, we encountered issues in determining relevant features to use when building machine learning models. In the above approach, we limited the set of features for analysis to dog demographic data. This seemed more relevant, and in some cases did produce moderate correlation scores with the predicted health condition. However, it is possible that other features in the Dog Aging Project Owner data set (or other data sets from the Dog Aging Project) may have produced better outcomes when seeking to predict the presence of certain health conditions.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, future efforts to predict health conditions should seek to leverage larger data sets (more records, not necessarily more features) as well as advanced methods for leveraging the data from the minority class.</p>
